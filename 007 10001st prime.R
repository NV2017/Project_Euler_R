# 007 10001st prime

# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

# What is the 10 001st prime number?

# Using numbers of the form 6kÂ±1 is certainly one of the most efficient approaches for an unknown upper limit; 
# that is, continuing through good "prime candidates" until you arrive at the nth prime.

Indexer <- 3 # Because for the first two prime: 2 & 3, the 6k +/- 1 rule doesn't work
